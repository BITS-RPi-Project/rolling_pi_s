# Raspberry Pi Weather Station

## CyberTank

The “CyberTank” is a Raspberry Pi hardware project that is envisaged to be a compact, easy to use water tank management, weather station and garden condition logging assistant. The primary focus is to provide efficient use of rainwater stored in a tank by monitoring tank level, local weather and soil conditions to automate a watering system, operated by a solenoid output.  

The unit will connect to the home wireless network and have a user-friendly web interface to allow real time data to be shown, watering schedule and long-term trending of conditions.
